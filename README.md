Building UniReach PWA
We're building a PWA for UniReach, an on-demand mentoring platform that levels the playing field for disadvantaged Oxbridge applicants
An MVP of our PWA will have:
1. membership
2. live dashboard of requests underlain by mentor-mentee allocation
3. real-time messaging, ideally with the ability to share files
4. notifications
5. blog page
6. automated sign-up and request processing

Current idea is to use React for the system and a MongoDB database, since it works well with an ExpressJS API and is quicker than SQL at scale
